"""Print a requirement list from pyproject.toml, for the image build to install.

The Dockerfile installs third-party dependencies in a stage that sees
pyproject.toml and nothing else, so that layer's cache key is one file's digest
and editing the source does not throw the install away. To do that it needs the
requirements as something pip can read — and that list has to come OUT of
pyproject.toml rather than be restated in the Dockerfile, because a second copy
is a second thing to keep in step and the way it fails is an image built
against dependencies nobody declared.

It lives here rather than inline in a `RUN` because a script can be linted,
imported and tested, and a heredoc can only be read.
